# Document clustering
we make use of K-means clustering technique to cluster the documents
in this code we make use of cosine similarity measure and create three clusters 
the documents to be clusterd are kept in document directory.
it basically run on Linux sytem because to create directory we use ( Linux sytem commands)
and we change those commands to corresponding os system commands to run on any os.
